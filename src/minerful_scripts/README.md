MINERful
=========================
THIS PART OF THE PROJECT WAS ADOPTED FROM THE LIBRARY WRITTEN BY CLAUDIO DI CICCIO AT https://github.com/cdc08x/MINERful
GO TO THE SOURCE FOR YOUR OWN RESEARCH OR REPRODUCTION.  


MINERful is a fast process mining tool for discovering declarative process models out of event logs. Event logs can be either real or synthetic, stored as [XES](http://www.xes-standard.org/) files or text documents with strings (every character is considered as an event, every line as a trace). Among the other things, MINERful can also create synthetic logs and export them as [XES](http://www.xes-standard.org/) or [MXML](http://www.processmining.org/logs/mxml) files, simplify existing Declare models, and import/export models written in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) or in the ConDec native language. Simply play around with it!

For updated info on the installation, usage, etc., please refer to the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/cdc08x/MINERful/wiki)!
